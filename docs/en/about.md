The Richard Gr端n Institute (RGI) was founded by my grandfather Prof. dr. Richard Gr端n founded.   
It used to be predominantly concrete, then other building materials. Through my father Dr. Wolfgang Gr端n was taken to the area of the facades with the associated building physics. That's why I've been working intensively with facades for 25 years. For this I have examined many facades, advised, planned and partly executed. The Richard Gr端n Institute has laboratories in which relevant examinations are carried out on facades. Here are also the static, building physics and air conditioning calculations.

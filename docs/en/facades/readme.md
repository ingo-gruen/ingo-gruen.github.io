#### Many façade faults have created the need to develop a façade that does not have the often existing defects. Added to this is the problem of leading the production of facades from crafts into industrialization. This happens only rarely in Germany. Because the construction of facades has developed from the window construction and which is strongly crafted.  
#### The RGI façade was therefore developed to achieve consistent industrialized production. That is the peculiarity of this facade, also in Germany.
